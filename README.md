=====

Symbolic expressions for Scala. Implements expression parsing, pretty-printing and (basic) simplification, with
rules appropriate for:

- rings,
- fields,
- real numbers (Spire Trig[A]).

The library is heavily based on [Spire](https://github.com/non/spire), and 
uses [Kiama](http://code.google.com/p/kiama/) for expression pretty-printing 
and tree rewriting.

The license is MIT.
